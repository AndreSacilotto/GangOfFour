The desing patterns of GOF were made in 1994, in this not even java was a thing. With that said I belive that some patterns are useless with the new tools that majority of new languages have today.

So here is my list of probaly usefull patterns (in 2020):

Abstract Factory
Factory
Prototype*
Singleton

Adapter
Facade
Flyweight

Command
Iterator*
Observer
State
Strategy*


When a pattern have a "*" that mean the pattern is already implemented in some form in the c# language.
